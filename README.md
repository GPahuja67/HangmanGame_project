PROJECT TITLE: Hangman Game

Description:
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. 
The guessing player has six attempts to figure out the word before the hangman is completed. It's a fun and challenging game that tests your vocabulary skills.
For programming this game, we have used python language. We have implemented functions used in python for displaying the hangman, checking guesses, and updating the game state.
